# Python to MIPS compiler

Build with

```bash
build.sh
```

Run with

```bash
./compiler <input_file> <output_file>.asm
```

Run tests with

```bash
./test.sh
```

The compiler will generate a MIPS assembly file that can be run with the MARS(<https://github.com/dpetersanderson/MARS/>) simulator.

There are some bugs that need to be fixed, please create an issue if you find any.
